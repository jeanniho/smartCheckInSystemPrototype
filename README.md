# smartcheckin_

This Flutter and Dart application is a prototype for a checkin/checkout smart system that could be used at a residence or compound such as student accomodation residence. It accomodate checkin/checkout of visitors as well. The aim was to back it up with Firebase database. Three of my friends and I came up with this project as a means to learn and enhance our Flutter and Dart skills but we were unable to continue with it due to unforseen circumstances.
